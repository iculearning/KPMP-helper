    "If the first tissue core is adequate for diagnostic workup (cortex visualized and the core is >1.4 cm in length) or when after two or more passes, two or three tissue cores are obtained, with at least one considered adequate for diagnostic workup, are obtained, the tissue core assigned for diagnostic workup is processed as a diagnostic core (see section 2.1.1) \n",
    "\n",
    "The diagnostic core will be divided in three parts with a minimum of 0.1-0.2 cm of cortex fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde for\n",
    "electron microscopy studies (container 3), 0.3 cm cortex snap frozen in OCT for immunofluorescence studies (container 2 – Ziploc bag), and the remaining amount of tissue fixed in 10% neutral buffered formaldehyde (formalin) (container 1) (see Figure 3, 4, and 7). \n",
    "\n",
    "If the amount of cortex is less than 0.5cm, the entire core goes toward light microscopy and placed in formalin (see also section 1.5.3). The remaining cores are immediately triaged as tissue interrogation cores 2 and 3. Cores 2 and 3 will be placed in the appropriate media or fixatives and shipped to the CBR for distribution to the TIS (see Figure 7 and section 3 for details). The goal will be to triage the tissue cores within 5 minutes post harvesting.\n",
