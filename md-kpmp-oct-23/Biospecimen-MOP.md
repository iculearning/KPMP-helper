# Biospecimen Manual of Procedures (MOP)
Version 10
August 30, 2023

# 1. Introduction
This Manual of Operating Procedures is provided for KPMP Recruitment Sites (RS) for biospecimen collection,
processing, and local storage prior to shipment to the Central Biorepository. It will outline the procedures for obtaining
blood, urine, and stool from KPMP participants, as well as processing each sample type and local storage for all samples.
The KPMP Research Coordinator is responsible for collecting samples from consented participants, returning samples to
the local lab for processing and storage, processing select samples (where appropriate training has been received), and
shipping samples to the Central Biorepository (CBR) for further redistribution, processing, and storage. In the absence of
the Research Coordinator, the Site PI or designated alternate would provide this service.


1.1 Safety Precautions for Handling All Biospecimens
• Obtain and utilize necessary protective clothing/equipment when working with all specimens. Such items
include but are not limited to lab coats, gloves, protective eyewear, and absorbent pads. All specimens are
handled as potentially infectious agents.
• Wear disposable gloves when collecting and processing specimens. Wash hands thoroughly with disinfectant
soap prior to leaving the work area. Skin cuts or abrasions should be covered.
• It is recommended that aliquoting and processing specimens be done within a biological safety cabinet (or at
least behind a plexiglass splash shield, if a biological safety cabinet is unavailable).
• Use 0.1% sodium hypochlorite (i.e. diluted household bleach) to clean up spills of blood, plasma, or serum. Use
this solution to clean up all lab work surfaces at the start and completion of work activities.
• Dispose of all needles and tubing in puncture-resistant sharps containers for safe disposal.
• Do not perform any pipetting by mouth for any reason.
• Avoid formation of potentially infectious aerosols by careful pipetting and centrifugation.
• Dispose of all used vacutainer tubes, needles and blood products in a spill proof liquid biohazard sharps
container for disposal.

# 2. Biospecimen Sample Collection


2.1 Overview
Specimens will be collected at baseline (pre-biopsy for CKD participants; preferably pre-biopsy for AKI. See Tables 1 & 2),
during the hospitalization for AKI participants, and at all follow-up study visits. Figure 1 details the samples that will be
collected by visit. For detailed descriptions, please refer to specific sections in the MOP for instructions pertaining to (1)
collection and handling, (2) processing, and (3) aliquot and storage of each sample type.

2.2 Allowable Sample Collection Time Windows for the Baseline Visit (AKI and CKD) and Post-biopsy Sample
Collection (AKI only)
2.2.1. General principles:
The preference is for all samples to be collected as close to and before the biopsy as possible (see ‘Ideal Sample
Collection Time Point’ column in Tables 1 and 2). In acknowledgment that clinical circumstances may not always make
the ideal sample collection time point reasonable, Tables 1 and 2 also outline the allowable windows, pre- and post-
biopsy, in which samples may be collected.
NOTE: As a general rule, all efforts should be made to complete all baseline collections pre-biopsy, and as close to the
biopsy as possible. If samples cannot be obtained within the allowable time window, do not discard the sample.


2.2.2 CKD Participants:
Baseline sample collection window for CKD participants is listed in Table 1.
Table 1 Baseline CKD Sample Collection Window
Sample Type Ideal Sample
Collection Time Point
Allowable Pre-Biopsy
Collection Window
Allowable Post-Biopsy
Collection Time Point
Blood As close to biopsy as possible Up to 6 weeks prior to biopsy Not allowable
Spot Urine As close to biopsy as possible Up to 6 weeks prior to biopsy Not allowable
Timed 24-Hour
Urine
As close to biopsy as possible Up to 6 weeks prior to biopsy
Discouraged, but if
necessary, wait 1 week post-
biopsy but do not exceed 1
month post-biopsy (i.e. 7-30
days post-biopsy)
Stool As close to biopsy as possible Up to 6 weeks prior to biopsy Allowable up to 7 days post-
biopsy, but discouraged


2.2.3 AKI Participants:
Baseline sample collection window for AKI participants is listed in Table 2.
AKI participants may have a central line in place for blood draw for clinical indications, which may be used for blood
collection. In the absence of a central line, a venipuncture will need to be done to obtain the blood specimen; when
possible, this should be timed to coincide with a clinical lab draw to reduce the number of needle sticks.
NOTE ON PRIORITIZATION: Particularly in AKI participants, the local hospital may impose daily blood draw limits for
research purposes that are less than the outlined volumes in this MOP. In these scenarios, it is allowable to spread the
blood collection over a few days. See Table 5 for the revised blood collection schedule. Strive to collect all tubes pre-
biopsy, but do not delay the biopsy in order to accomplish this goal. Collect as much as possible pre-biopsy. Similarly,
some participants may not be able to provide both a spot and a timed urine collection in the time before the biopsy. In
these scenarios, the spot urine collection should be prioritized, followed by however much of a timed urine collection (if
any) is possible.

Following the biopsy for AKI participants, an additional 10 mL EDTA blood sample will be collected every 24 hours post-
biopsy (+/- 12 hours, as is clinically feasible) and repeat spot urine collection of 20 mL should be done every 24 hours(all
+/- 12 hours, as is clinically feasible). These daily EDTA and spot urine collection should continue until discharge, or until
day 7 post-biopsy. Table 3 outlines the allowable windows for post-biopsy sample collections for AKI participants.

# 3. Blood


3.1. Blood Collection & Handling Instructions
The blood draw will be done by the research coordinator or other qualified staff or phlebotomist at all sites. Blood will
be drawn into several tubes.


3.1.1 Equipment
The Central Biorepository (CBR), which is located at the University of Michigan, will provide all blood collection tubes
and a sample-ID specific Blood Processing Worksheet in the participant’s KPMP kit. All collection tubes are to be stored
at room temperature prior to collection. The Standard Blood Kit and Post-Biopsy Blood Kit that CBR provides are shown
in the images below. Please note that tube types and volumes may change as needed in response to supply shortages,
backorders, or discontinuations.
The recruitment site should provide the rest of the supplies needed for blood collection, listed here:
• Test tube rack to hold the blood collection tubes
• Plastic vacutainer needle holder
• Vacutainer Luer slip adaptors to connect the butterfly
• 21 G butterfly needles
• Sterile alcohol swabs
• Gauze sponges
• Tourniquet
• Bandages (Band Aids)
• Stopwatch
• Waste disposal container for sharps
• Smelling salts


3.1.2 Blood collection
Blood collection preparation should be done in the following manner:
1. Check to make sure all materials are present, in good condition and not expired, and properly labeled with
appropriate kit ID. If materials are expired, set them aside and do not use. Contact the CBR via the REDCap
Inventory Management tool to order replacement supplies.
2. Arrange blood collection tubes from the CBR in test tube rack, in draw order (see Table 4).
3. Note the Kit ID, blood draw date/time, and whether the participant was fasting on the Blood Collection form in
REDCap (see Section 9).
4. Ensure the centrifuge and freezer are working properly.
The phlebotomy room should meet these criteria:
1. Ideally, blood draw should take place in an isolated room or with participants separated by room dividers.
2. The room must be equipped with all of the necessary blood specimen supplies (see 3.1.1).
3. The centrifuge and freezer should be nearby (to minimize processing delay).
The venipuncture should follow this procedure:
1. The participant is asked whether he/she has a bleeding disorder before the blood is drawn. If such a disorder is
present, ask the participant whether he/she has had blood drawn previously and if so, whether he/she had any
problems with excessive bleeding or bruising at the venipuncture site. If the participant has a history of
venipuncture problems, the participant should be sampled only if approved by the physician.
2. Ask the participant if he/she or his/her doctor have a preference as to which vein to use to determine whether
or not he/she has been told to protect a particular vein or particular upper extremity.
3. If not, it is recommended that the medial-most antecubital vein in the dominant arm is used, assuming that the
non-dominant arm will be the access arm of choice if the subject goes on to need dialysis, and that the medial
most antecubital vein is not likely to be the draining cephalic vein.
4. The venipuncture is performed with a 21 gauge butterfly needle with 12 inches of plastic tubing between the
venipuncture site and the blood collection tubes. The butterfly has a small, walled needle which minimizes
trauma to the skin and vein. The use of 12 inches of tubing allows tubes to be changed without any movement
of the needle in the vein. If the participant is concerned about the venipuncture, he/she may be reassured to
know such care is taken.
5. The participant should be given enough time to feel comfortable both before and after the blood collection. In
many cases the most memorable part of the experience will be the contact with the technologist who draws the
blood and his/her general attitude and competence.
6. Handling participants who are extremely apprehensive about having blood drawn:
a. Do not under any circumstances force the participant to have blood drawn.
b. If the participant is nervous or excited, the technologist should briefly describe the procedure:
i. “I am going to be drawing about four (4) tablespoons of blood. This blood will be used in tests
for kidney function and other research analyses.”
c. Explain to the participant that the blood drawing is designed to be as nearly painless as possible. It is
sometimes best to let the participant go on with another part of the visit.
d. Have the participant relax in the blood drawing chair just so the phlebotomist can check the veins in the
participant’s arms, without actually drawing blood.
e. If the participant has “good veins” the phlebotomist can reassuringly say, “Oh, you have good veins;
there should be no problem.”
7. Preparation:
a. Remove all extra clothing and have the participant sit upright with the sleeves rolled up to expose the
antecubital fossa (elbow).
b. A tourniquet is used to increase venous filling. It makes the veins more prominent and easier to enter.
8. Precautions When Using a Tourniquet:
a. The tourniquet should be on the arm for the shortest time possible.
b. Never leave the tourniquet on for longer than two (2) minutes. To do so may result in
hemoconcentration or a variation of blood test values.
c. If a tourniquet must be applied for the preliminary vein selection, it should be released and reapplied
after a wait of two minutes.
d. If the participant has a skin problem, put the tourniquet over the participant’s shirt or use a piece of
gauze or paper tissue so as not to pinch the skin.
e. Wrap the tourniquet around the arm 3 to 4 inches (7.5 to 10.0 cm) above the venipuncture site.
f. Tuck the end of the tourniquet under the last round. If a Velcro tourniquet is used, adhere the ends to
each other.
9. Identify the vein:
a. Palpate and trace the path of veins several times with the index finger. Thrombosed veins lack
resilience, feel cord-like, and roll easily.
b. If superficial veins are not readily apparent, have the participant close his or her fist.
c. Lowering the extremity over the arm of the chair will allow the veins to fill to capacity.
d. Identify the best available vein.
10. Cleanse the venipuncture site.
a. Remove alcohol pad from its sterile package.
b. Cleanse the vein site with the alcohol pad using a circular motion from the center to the periphery.
c. Allow the area to dry to prevent possible hemolysis of the specimen and a burning sensation to the
participant when the venipuncture is performed.
11. Assemble the butterfly-vacutainer set.
a. Attach the Luer adaptor to the vacutainer holder, when applicable.
b. Attach the Luer end of the butterfly needle set to the Luer adaptor.
12. Perform venipuncture:
a. Grasp the participant’s arm firmly, using your thumb to draw the skin taut. This anchors the vein. The
thumb should be 1 or 2 inches (2.3 or 5.0 cm) below the venipuncture site.
b. With the needle bevel upward, enter the vein in a smooth continuous motion.
c. Make sure the participant’s arm is in a flat or downward position while maintaining the tube below the
site when the needle is in the vein. It may be helpful to have the participant make a fist with the
opposite hand and place it under the elbow for support.
d. Grasp the flange of the needle holder and push the tube forward until the butt end of the needle
punctures the stopper, exposing the full lumen of the needle.
e. Start a timer to measure the flow rate of blood into the first blood collection tube (see Table 4 for draw
prioritization). If the flow rate in the tube is so slow that blood does not fill the first collection tube
within 50 seconds, stop the blood collection and repeat on the other arm. If blood is flowing freely, the
butterfly tubing can be anchored to the participant’s arm using medical tape for the duration of the
draw.
f. Remove the tourniquet after blood is flowing into the second tube.
g. Keep a constant, slight forward pressure (in the direction of the needle) on the end of the tube. This
prevents release of the shutoff valve and stopping of blood flow. Do not vary pressure nor reintroduce
pressure after completion of the draw.
h. Fill each vacutainer tube as completely as possible; i.e., until the vacuum is exhausted and blood flow
ceases. If a vacutainer tube fills only partially, remove the vacutainer and attach another one without
removing needle from vein.
i. When the blood flow ceases, remove the tube from the holder. The shutoff valve recovers the point,
stopping blood flow until the next tube is inserted.
j. All tubes EXCEPT SERUM SEPARATOR (tiger top) should be gently mixed by inverting immediately after
each tube is filled and removed from the butterfly setup.
k. If it is not possible to collect all of the desired tubes, follow the requested order (Table 4) and fill each
tube as completely as possible.
13. Prevent blood mixing during venipuncture.
a. Immediately invert tubes containing anticoagulant (i.e. all except serum separator (tiger top)). See
Figure 2.
b. DO NOT SHAKE TUBES! Vigorous mixing or shaking can break the cells.
c. Invert each tube slowly and gently 10 times. See Figure 2.
14. If a blood sample is not forthcoming, the following manipulations may be helpful:
a. If there is a sucking sound, the tube has lost its vacuum. Replace with a
new tube.
b. If no blood appears, move the needle slightly in hope of entering vein. Do
Not Probe. If not successful, release tourniquet and remove needle. A
second attempt can be made on the other arm.
c. The same technician should not attempt a venipuncture more than twice.
15. Finishing
a. To remove the needle, lightly place clean gauze over venipuncture site. Remove the needle quickly and
immediately apply pressure to the site with a gauze pad.
b. Discard needle with its vacutainer needle holder into a sharps container.
16. Bandage the arm.
a. Under normal conditions:
i. Slip the gauze pad down over the site, continuing mild pressure.
ii. Apply an adhesive or gauze bandage over the venipuncture site after making sure blood flow
has stopped.
b. If the participant continues to bleed:
i. Apply pressure to the site with a gauze pad. Keep the arm elevated until the bleeding stops.
ii. Wrap the gauze bandage tightly around the arm over the pad.
iii. Tell the participant to leave the bandage on for at least 15 minutes.
17. Precautions –If a participant feels faint or looks faint following the blood draw:
a. Have the person remain in the chair; if necessary, have him/her sit with head between knees.
b. Take an ampule of smelling salts, crush it, and wave it under person’s nose for a few seconds.
c. Provide the person with a basin if he/she feels nauseous.
d. Have the person stay reclined until their color returns and he/she feels better.
e. Place a cold wet cloth on the back of the person’s neck.
f. If the person faints, use smelling salts to revive.
g. If the person continues to feel sick, take a blood pressure and pulse reading. Contact a medical staff
member, who will advise you on further action.
The date and time of draw, as well as whether the participant was fasting, will be documented on the Blood Collection
CRF in REDCap (see Section 9). The approximate volume collected should be noted. It is OK to eyeball the volume in the
tube; if volume seems low, coordinators may use the free-text Notes field on REDCap to provide an explanation, when
known. Use the form in Section 9 as a paper worksheet as needed, then transfer to REDCap.
Additionally, the method of blood collection must be documented on the Blood Collection CRF (see Section 9).
The methods of blood collection are as follows:
• venipuncture/needle stick
• arterial line
• central line
Figure 2. Tube inversion
Do NOT draw from a peripheral line, unless it’s freshly inserted, not previously flushed, sufficiently large caliber.
Otherwise, there is risk that the sample could be impacted by contamination, dilution, and/or hemolysis.


3.1.3 Re-Draw Scenarios
The target blood draw volume is approximately 50 mL and the draw order is outlined in Table 4. All tubes should be
completely filled. If a tube is under-filled, do not re-draw.
A re-draw may be warranted in certain situations:
• If damage or loss occurs to a tube for which there are no spares (e.g. the PAXgene or ACD tubes), re-draw may
be attempted for CKD participants. If the damage or loss impacts a tube from an AKI participant, the tube should
not be re-drawn as AKI is quite dynamic and the timing of the draw in relation to the biopsy may no longer be
valuable. The site should use discretion to identify a good time to approach the CKD participant about a re-draw;
it could be a separate visit or during the next scheduled in-person visit. The site will need to work with the
Central Biorepository to request a new tube.
• If baseline biosamples are collected and then the biopsy is delayed such that the allowable pre-biopsy collection
window is surpassed (see Tables 1 and 2), re-draw may be attempted. A new kit should be selected and a new
iteration of the biosample form should be generated in REDCap (use the + icon). The original samples should not
be disposed of; they should be shipped to CBR and may be utilized for future quality control checks.
If delivery of the ACD tube to the CBR is delayed:
If ACD tube is received the day after the draw or sooner, CBR processes as normal.
If ACD tube is received later than the day after the draw, CBR does not process the tube. We will attempt a re-draw for
CKD sites but not for AKI sites.

Invert all tubes, except serum separator tube (tiger top), as per the collection instructions (section 3.1.2). Tubes are
inverted slowly and gently; DO NOT SHAKE TUBES. See Figure 2 and the ‘Collection Instructions’ column in Table 4.
The ‘Pre-Processing Instructions’ column in Tables 4 and 5 describe the conditions in which tubes should be handled
immediately following collection:
• Blood collected in Lithium Heparin (green) and EDTA (purple) tubes should be stored at 4°C until ready to begin
processing, as storage at room temperature will degrade some of the biomarkers.
• SST (tiger top) tube should remain upright at room temperature for 30 minutes prior to processing. It should
then be immediately processed, but if this is not feasible, store at 4°C until able to begin processing.
• ACD (yellow) tubes should be stored at room temperature until shipped at room temperature on same day as
collection.
• PAXgene (clear) tubes must be stored at room temperature (18-25°C) for 2 hours and up to 72 hours before
transfer to a -80°C freezer.


3.2. Blood Processing Instructions
The goal is to process the samples within one hour of collection. The maximum allowable time between specimen
collection and processing is two hours. All times (venipuncture, start of centrifugation, freezer) should be recorded on
the processing worksheet provided in the Kit, for later transfer to SpecTrack. Do not discard samples if the maximum
allowable time to processing is exceeded; instead, process as normal, but be sure to note the times on the processing
worksheet/SpecTrack.
• Serum and plasma samples should complete centrifugation within 1 hour of collection and be aliquoted and
frozen within 2 hours of collection.
All samples can be centrifuged concurrently with the exception of the PAXgene® Blood RNA tube (clear), ACD tube
(yellow), and the stool samples which are NOT centrifuged or processed.
NOTE: Only process one participant’s samples at a time: never more. This will help limit the chances of accidental mix-
up of participant samples.


3.2.1 Equipment
• Centrifuge capable of achieving 2000 x G and 4°C (NOTE: G is not the same as RPM; please consult your
centrifuge conversion table if necessary).
• Aerosol spray covers for centrifuge buckets (or other form of cover for safety purposes, per institutional policy)
• Pipettor and pipette tips, sterile transfer pipette
• Participant’s kit provided by the CBR with pre-labeled cryovials and worksheet of kit contents
• Aliquot rack
• Waste disposal containers and sharps container
• Cardboard freezer boxes and metal racks
• Freezer at -80 ˚C
• SAFETY Gear: obtain and utilize necessary protective clothing/equipment for preparing an aliquot of specimens.
Such items include but are not limited to lab coats, gloves, protective eyewear, and absorbent pads.


3.2.2 Centrifuge Instructions
1. Balance the centrifuge to ensure proper performance of the instrument. If needed, use a “balance tube” filled
with water to the proper level to achieve balance.
2. Once the centrifuge is loaded with samples, set the speed to 2000 x G, the time to 12 minutes and the
temperature to 4°C for processing. It is recommended that aerosol spray covers for centrifuge buckets be used.
All tubes are spun with the exception of the PAXgene RNA tube, ACD tube, and stool samples, which are not
processed further locally.
3. If the centrifuge is equipped with a brake, it may be used to accelerate the stopping time (without the brake a
centrifuge typically takes about 10 minutes to stop).
4. Once the centrifuge has stopped, open the centrifuge and remove the specimens.
5. Note whether the sample has hemolyzed on the Blood Collection CRF (see Section 9). Indicate ‘Yes’ if there is
any degree of hemolysis (i.e. if the plasma or serum is orange or red). See image below.


3.3. Blood Aliquot & Storage Instructions


3.3.1 Overview and Best Practices
1. For the centrifuged specimens, verify that the cells have been clearly separated from the serum or plasma by
visibly noting the serum and plasma are distinctly above the packed red blood cells and white blood cell layers.
2. Process all specimens concurrently by type (i.e. all blood together, all urine together) to the extent possible.
3. Carefully open the blood tube using the universal precautions previously described.
4. Use a calibrated, mechanical pipette to transfer the sample from the primary tube to the appropriately labeled
secondary tubes/cryovials.
o Please pay careful attention to the accuracy of volumes pipetted.
o Please do not underfill aliquots in order to stretch a low volume collection – prioritize aliquoting the
prescribed volume in each tube filled versus filling all of the tubes with some sample (i.e. it’s preferable
to provide five aliquots with the correct volume than eight underfilled aliquots). Always use a clean
pipette tip for each sample type.
o Do not use a bulb-topped transfer pipette, as it is difficult to obtain precise volumes. Recommended
skill: Reverse pipetting (see video at https://youtu.be/HKO4dAvb7rg)
o Reverse pipetting helps ensure proper volumes. To reverse-pipet the proper volume into the aliquot tube,
set your pipet to the desired volume. Push the plunger down to the first stop (to become familiar with
how far down to push for the correct volume), then push the plunger down to the second stop. Insert the
pipet tip into the primary sample and slowly draw up until the plunger is fully extended. Move the pipet
tip to the empty aliquot vial and dispense the sample by pushing down on the plunger to the first stop
with the pipet tip resting against the side of the aliquot tube. For subsequent aliquots, keep the pipet tip
at the first stop and draw up the next sample and dispense to the first stop, repeating as many times as
needed. This approach keeps a small volume in the pipet tip at all times and ensures that the correct
amount is dispensed for each aliquot.
5. When pipetting the plasma be very careful not to disturb the buffy coat (white cell layer) and when pipetting the
serum be very careful not to disturb the serum separator layer.
6. Store all aliquots in a plastic rack or cardboard box in an upright position at -80˚C (with the exception of the ACD
(yellow) tube, which is stored at room temperature) immediately following completion of processing. Label the
racks or cardboard boxes with permanent marker or an adhesive label that can be easily identified. See Section
6 for additional details about Local Storage.

3.3.2 Aliquot and/or Storage Instructions by Sample Type
3.3.2.1 Serum Separator Tube (SST) Instructions (tiger top)
1. Allow tube to clot upright for 30 minutes prior to processing.
2. Place tube in the centrifuge and spin per instructions in section 3.2.2.
3. Pipet 0.5 mL of serum into each corresponding cryovial provided by the CBR in the
participant’s kit.
a. Fill as many of the ten (10) available cryovials with serum from tiger top tubes
as possible. Cryovials 1 through 9 should be filled with 0.5 mL serum. The final cryovial has 1.5 mL
capacity (the cap is marked with a red + sign; the rest of the caps are solid red). Fill the final cryovial with
up to 1.5 mL serum.
4. Note volumes of filled cryovials and the IDs of unused cryovials on the Blood Processing Worksheet in the Kit for
reference later when cryovial details are noted in SpecTrack.
5. Put the cryovials into the labeled box and place them into the -80 ˚C until shipment to the CBR.
3.3.2.2 EDTA Tube Instructions (purple tops)
1. Process the tube in the centrifuge per section 3.2.2.
2. Pipet 0.5 mL of plasma into each corresponding cryovial provided by the CBR in the participant’s kit.
Aspirate slowly starting at the top of the plasma. (NOTE: when pipetting for the baseline (pre-biopsy)
and first annual follow-up visits, be sure not to allow the pipet tip to get any closer than one-half inch
from the buffy coat; this will be used for the for cell pellet preparation for DNA isolation. Set aside for
Step 5.) DO NOT DISCARD.
a. Fill as many of the ten (10) available cryovials with purple caps as possible. Cryovials 1 through 9 should
be filled with 0.5 mL plasma. The final cryovial has 1.5 mL capacity (the cap is marked with a purple +
sign; the rest of the caps are solid purple). Fill the final cryovial with up to 1.5 mL plasma.
b. Repeat step 2a with the contents of the second EDTA tube.
3. Note volumes of filled cryovials and the IDs of unused cryovials on the Blood Processing Worksheet in the Kit for
reference later when cryovial details are noted in SpecTrack.
4. Put the cryovials into a labeled box and place them in the -80 ˚C freezer until shipment to the CBR.
5. BASELINE (PRE-BIOPSY) AND FIRST ANNUAL VISIT ONLY: Packed Cell Preparation for DNA Isolation (see Figure
4):
NOTE: the packed cell pellet for DNA extraction is collected only at the baseline (pre-biopsy) and first annual follow-
up visits. For all other EDTA collections, simply aliquot the plasma into the ten cryovials, as described in step 2
above.
a. After aliquoting the top 2/3 of the plasma supernatant from the two EDTA tubes as described above
(see Figure 4B and example image below), use a sterile soft bulb plastic transfer pipette to slow aspirate
the remaining ½” layer of plasma, the buffy coat and some of the red cells from the tube (see Figure
4C). Take care not to aspirate the buffy coat into the bulb of the pipette.
“Ring” the tube with the pipette by carefully aspirating along the wall at the buffy coat layer to ensure
maximum transfer.
Image: Example EDTA tube at stage represented in Figure 4B
b. Dispense up to 4.0 mL into the 4 mL packed cell aliquot vial (see Figure 4C).
c. Still using the same pipet, go back and transfer the remaining packed red cells from the tube in to the
same 4 mL packed cell aliquot vial (see Figure 4D). Add up to, but not more than, 4.0 mL to the 4 mL
vial. This step will ensure that all the buffy coat is adequately rinsed from the pipet.
d. Tightly fasten the screw cap on this vial and place it in the -80˚C freezer until shipment to the CBR (see
Figure 4E).

cell layers, pipet the top 2/3 of the clear plasma supernatant filling the corresponding cryovials as described in step
3.3.2.2. Leave a ½-inch layer of plasma above the buffy coat-red blood cell layers as described above. Using a sterile
plastic transfer pipet, slowly aspirate the remaining ½” layer of plasma, the buffy coat and some of the red cells from
the tube. Take care not to aspirate the buffy coat into the bulb of the pipet! ‘Ring’ the tube with the pipet by carefully
aspirating along the wall at the buffy coat layer to ensure maximum transfer. Dispense into the 4-mL packed cell
aliquot vial. Still using the same pipet, go back and transfer the remaining packed red cells from the tube into the
same 4-mL DNA vial, up to a volume of 4.0 mL. This step will ensure that all of the buffy coat is adequately rinsed from
the pipet. Tightly fasten the screw cap on this vial and place it in the -80°C freezer until shipment to the CBR.

3. Package tube in absorbent sleeve and then ambient temperature mailer for immediate shipment to the CBR
(must be shipped same day as collection; see Section 8 for details).
4. PBMC isolation will occur at the CBR.
*Note that ACD will be shipped separately from the other tubes at room temperature and not on dry ice. See section 8
for shipping instructions.
3.3.2.5 PAXgene® RNA tube Instructions (clear top)*
1. Store the PAXgene® Blood RNA tube upright at room temperature for at least two hours.
2. Note details on the Blood Processing Worksheet in the Kit for reference later when details are noted in
SpecTrack
3. Place the PAXgene® Blood RNA tube upright in a metal rack in a -80 ˚C freezer until shipment to the CBR.
Do not place tubes in tight test tube containers such as Styrofoam or Plastic as this may lead the tube to
break. Tubes should be loosely hanging in place in the metal rack.
4. Urine


4.1 Spot Urine Collection & Handling Instructions
A urine sample (“spot urine”) will be collected at all visits.
Baseline volumes (CKD and AKI): At least 60 and ideally 120 mL of urine should be collected from the participant. If less
than 60 mL is collected for the baseline spot, a replacement collection may be considered if it can be obtained pre-
biopsy and does not present undue burden on the participant. The initial collection (<60 mL) should be processed
normally in case a second collection is not obtained or does not surpass the initial volume. The collection of greatest
volume should be kept and sent to CBR; the smaller volume may be disposed.
All other collections (post-biopsy for AKI, 3-month for AKI, and all annual follow-up for AKI and CKD): 20 mL of urine
should be collected from the participant.
If there is not enough urine, do not pool urine from separate voids (i.e., from different times of the day), even if the
desired volume is not achieved. Participants should do a clean catch void, if at all possible. Please refer to clean catch
void instructions in section 4.1.2. Instructions for collection when the participant has an indwelling urinary catheter are
also included in section 4.1.3.

4.1.2 Clean Catch Procedures
Participants should do a clean catch void, if at all possible. A clean catch specimen is a way of collecting urine that does
not contain a lot of bacteria from the skin. Do not take urine from participants who have urostomy bags. Procedures
for collecting a clean catch void are outlined below. See Appendix 10.1 for Clean-catch instructions for participants
giving a spot urine sample.
Instructions for Research Coordinators:
1. Give the participant the provided urine collection cup.
a. It might be helpful to give the participant the cup in a bag which includes the towelettes.
2. Provide instructions to the participant about the collection procedures (see below and Appendix 10.1).
3. Record (on Spot Urine CRF, Section 9) the:
a. exact time that the participant provides the urine sample
b. the method of collection
c. whether the participant is fasting and hours NPO
d. total volume collected in mL
e. if the participant menstruating - female participants only
4. Store sample on wet ice or refrigerate (4˚C) until ready to process
Instructions for Participants:
Please follow these instructions to collect a clean-catch midstream urine specimen:
1. Wash your hands with soap and water.
2. Remove the lid of the urine container, taking care not to touch the inside of the container.
3. Follow the appropriate instructions below:
4. Start to urinate into the toilet, then stop. Do not collect the first amount of urine.
5. Begin urinating into the urine container; stop when it is approximately ¾ full.
6. Finish urinating into the toilet.
7. Place the lid on the urine container.
8. Bring the container to the research coordinator.
FEMALE MALE
Separate your genital folds (also called lips
or labia) and gently wipe the inside of the
folds with an antiseptic towelette, wiping
from front to back.
Before you start urinating, gently wipe the tip of
the penis around the opening with antiseptic
towelette. If you have not been circumcised and
still have your foreskin, gently pull the foreskin
back before you wash the tip of the penis. Keep
holding it back until you are finished getting the
urine sample.


4.1.3 Participants Unable to perform a Clean Catch Void
If the participant is able to spontaneously void but unable to perform a clean catch void due to physical constraints,
collect urine as outlined below.
1. Do not have the participant use antiseptic towelettes, as the cleaning agents in the towelettes may interfere
with some sensitive bioassays.
2. Have the participant void into a urinal (men) or a clean hat on positioned on the toilet or on a commode (men or
women).
3. Do not collect urine from a hat that is contaminated with stool.
4. Research coordinator should pour a small amount of urine into a labeled specimen cup.
5. Cap the container, avoid touching inside of container.
6. Record that the urine was not a clean catch on the Spot Urine Collection CRF (see Section 9).


4.1.5 Participants with a Foley Catheter
If participant has an indwelling urinary catheter, urine should be collected from the urine meter or the port on the
catheter tubing, not from the large drainage bag. Do not collect urine that has been sitting for more than two hours.
We recommend clamping the Foley tubing and then using a needleless system to get urine from the tube side port. A
nurse caring for the participant or a trained study coordinator may collect this specimen.
1. Place a clamp (e.g. a blue plastic clamp) on the tubing to block the flow of urine into the bag.
2. Wipe the needleless port on the Foley catheter bag with an alcohol wipe and allow it to dry.
3. Access the needleless port with a Luer-lock tip syringe and aspirate back urine.
4. Transfer contents to urine container for transport back to the processing lab.
5. Record that the urine was collected from a Foley catheter.


4.1.6 Steps in Processing Spot Urines
Spot urine samples are collected at all visits for CKD and AKI participants. The target volume for baseline visits is 120 mL;
for all other collections, the target volume is 20 mL.
4.1.6a Urine Dipstick Test
The urine dipstick test should be conducted on all spot urine samples. Readings should be recorded on the Spot Urine
CRF (see Section 9).
NOTE: The urine dipstick test must be performed on whole, unspun urine! Complete this step before centrifuging, and
as close to collection as possible.
Procedure:
1. Check the expiration date on the dipstick container and verify the date has not been exceeded.
2. Remove one strip from container and replace cap. Do not use the urine dipsticks after the expiration date. Take
care not to touch the reagent areas of the strip
3. Gently swirl the urine container to mix urine well prior to testing
4. Note the color and clarity of the unspun urine on the Spot Urine CRF (see Section 9).
5. Using a soft bulb pipette, aspirate 1-2 mL of urine and quickly pipette one drop onto each pad of the strip,
ensuring that all pads are soaked.
6. Remove excess urine by drawing edge of strip along the specimen container rim then blot edge of strip on a
paper towel.
7. Hold strip in a level in a horizontal position. This avoids possible mixing of dyes and chemicals from adjacent
pads.
8. Compare reagent pads to corresponding color chart on the bottle label. Hold the strip close to the color blocks
and match carefully, reading pads from bottom (glucose) to the top (leukocytes). Record the readings on the
Spot Urine CRF (see Section 9).
9. Discard the used strip after use according to local regulations.
Color changes that occur 2 minutes after dipping have no diagnostic value. Do not record. Refer to Table 7 for
proper reading time post-dip for analytes.
Note: if site has an automated analyzer for urinalysis, this may be used to obtain results of the dipstick
urinalysis. In this case, the paper readout should be saved in the participant’s record as source documentation.

4.1.6b Spot urine processing for a 120 mL collection
The goal is to process the samples within two hours of collection. The maximum allowable time between specimen
collection and processing is four hours. All times should be recorded on the processing worksheet provided in the Kit, for
later transfer to SpecTrack. Do not discard samples if the maximum allowable time to processing is exceeded; instead,
process as normal, but be sure to note the times on the processing worksheet/SpecTrack. When collected concurrently
with blood, blood should be processed before urine.
Take note of details on the Spot Urine Processing Worksheet from the Kit. For a 120 mL collection (See Figure 7):
1. After completing and recording the urine dipstick test, pour 15 mL into each of the eight 15 mL centrifuge
tubes. If less than 120 ml of urine is obtained, fill as many of the eight tubes as possible.
2. Centrifuge per section 3.2.2:
a. Balance the centrifuge to ensure proper performance of the instrument. If needed, use a “balance
tube” filled with water to the proper level to achieve balance.
b. Once the centrifuge is loaded with samples, set the speed to 2000 x G, the time to 12 minutes and
the temperature to 4°C for processing. It is recommended that aerosol spray covers for centrifuge
buckets be used.
3. Pipette supernatant directly from centrifuge tubes into 30 x 2 mL cryovials and 12 x 4.5 mL cryovials, filling the
2 mL cryovials first, and aliquoting the remaining supernatant into the larger tubes last. Fill the 2 mL cryovials
with 1.6 mL of supernatant and the 4.5 mL cryovials with 4.5 mL of supernatant. See Figure 7, step B. Fill as
many as possible, leaving the pellet at the bottom of the centrifuge tubes for step 5.
4. Mark on the Spot Urine Processing Worksheet how many vials were filled and what the pellet looks like (red,
white, or not visible) for later transfer to SpecTrack.
5. Pellet collection: The pellets from four of the eight 15 mL tubes will be stored in two separate cryovials (see
Figure 7). NOTE: The pellet collection process should be done even if the pellet is not visible.
a. Select four of the eight now supernatant-free 15 mL centrifuge tubes and add RNA-Later (enough to
cover the pellets: approximately 25-50 uL). See Figure 7, step C.
b. Stir the pipette tip to mix. Do not pipette up and down as this will cause cell breakage.
c. With the pipette, transfer the pellets from two tubes into a single cryovial. Repeat for the other two
tubes (into the second cryovial). See Figure 7, step D.
Figure 7. Spot Urine Processing for a 120 mL collection (Baseline only)
4.1.6c Spot urine processing for a 20 mL collection
The goal is to process the samples within two hours of collection. The maximum allowable time between specimen
collection and processing is four hours. All times should be recorded on the processing worksheet provided in the
Kit, for later transfer to SpecTrack. Do not discard samples if the maximum allowable time to processing is exceeded;
instead, process as normal, but be sure to note the times on the processing worksheet/SpecTrack. When collected
concurrently with blood, blood should be processed before urine.
For the 20 mL collections (i.e. post-biopsy for AKI, 3-month for AKI, and all annual follow-up for AKI and CKD):
1. After completing and recording the urine dipstick test, pour approximately 10 mL into each of the two 15 mL
conical centrifuge tubes.
2. Centrifuge per section 3.2.2.:
a. Balance the centrifuge to ensure proper performance of the instrument. If needed, use a “balance
tube” filled with water to the proper level to achieve balance.
b. Once the centrifuge is loaded with samples, set the speed to 2000 x G, the time to 12 minutes and
the temperature to 4°C for processing. It is recommended that aerosol spray covers for centrifuge
buckets be used.
3. Pipette supernatant directly from centrifuge tubes into ten 2 mL cryovials.
NOTE: aliquot only 1.6 mL of supernatant into the 2 mL cryovials.
4. No pellet is collected from these samples. Pellet is only collected for the 120 mL baseline collection.


4.2. Timed (8-24-Hour) Urine Collection & Handling Instructions
We will ask CKD participants to give a 24-hour timed urine sample at their baseline visit and AKI participants to give an 8-
24-hour timed urine sample at their baseline visit. CKD participants can be sent home with the collection kit and
instructed to return with it on the day of their biopsy. Instruct the participant to aim to complete the collection as close
to the time they will be returning to clinic as possible, and emphasize the importance of keeping the sample chilled
during collection and transportation. These steps help reduce bacterial growth and degradation of biomarkers. AKI
participants may be collected in hospital with a nurse’s assistance, as is clinically feasible.


4.2.1 Equipment
24 Hour Urine collection kit (Figure 8):
CBR will supply the following in the kit:
• 24 hour urine container/jug
• One 50 mL conical tube
• Ten (10) 4.5 mL cryovials
• Timed Urine Processing Worksheet
CBR will also provide the following in bulk:
• Urinal (male)
• Collection hat (female)
Timed urine kit contents can be stored at room
temperature.
The coordinator will need to acquire a urinal or
collection hat (as appropriate) from bulk storage
to include in the set of materials to give
participants for the timed urine collection.
The site will be responsible for the scale to weigh
the container (if possible).


4.2.2 Collection Procedures
We will give participants a urine collection jug,
along with written instructions (see Appendix 10.2) for collecting a timed urine sample. Women will be provided a
collection ‘hat’, which covers the toilet seat to make collection easier, and males will be provided a urinal. We ask
participants to start the timed urine collection in the morning when they wake. They flush the first void, but record the
date/time, then collect all subsequent voids until the following morning where they collect the first morning void and
write down the end date/time. AKI participants may provide timed samples from a Foley catheter.
Participants will be asked to keep the jug in the refrigerator or on ice, since it must be kept cold. If kept on ice, then the
ice should be at the level of the urine. If they can’t collect for the full 24 hours, then ask them to do it for as long as they
are able and ask them to record the start/end times on paper and on the container. The jug must be returned to the
research coordinators at the conclusion of the timed collection. This can be returned at their study visit.

The goal is to minimize the amount of time between when the collection is finished and the sample can be processed, in
order to preserve sensitive proteins and analytes. Ideally, the home collection can be completed in the morning right
before the participant comes in for their study visit. The goal is to return the sample to the RS for processing within 24
hours of completion. On rare occasions, when the option is greater flexibility or no timed urine sample at all, the
allowable window can be extended to 48 hours, but this will reduce sample quality and should be avoided when
possible.


4.2.3 Processing
Measure the total volume of urine collected and record this on the Timed Urine Collection CRF (see Section 9). You
should also measure and record the weight of the full jug, if you have a scale available. Gently swirl the container, and
then pour 50 mL of urine into the 50 mL conical tube for processing. If the sample will not be processed immediately,
the sample should be refrigerated or stored on ice. Centrifuge per section 3.2.2 and aliquot into ten 4.5-mL aliquots
(Figure 9). Record aliquot details on the Time Urine Processing Worksheet for transfer to SpecTrack.

# 5. Stool
Stool specimens will be collected by study participants. Participants will be
instructed on how to handle and store the samples prior to bringing them to
the research team/visit. See Appendix 10.3 for detailed Participant Stool
Collection and Storage Instructions.
KPMP will use the OMNIgene-GUT system for collecting and stabilizing
microbial DNA from fecal samples. Participants will collect a sample and use
the provided spatula to transfer a small amount of stool into the OMNIgene-
GUT tube. The tube contains a stabilizing liquid which, when well mixed with
the stool, will preserve the sample for up to sixty (60) days at room
temperature. During this time, the participant should return the sample to
the recruitment site and the recruitment site should ship the sample to the
CBR. Upon receipt, the CBR will aliquot and prepare the sample for
preservation. Ideally, the specimen should be collected no more than 24 hours before the participant’s study visit and/or
returning samples to the research team.
User instructions are provided in Appendix
10.3 and should be given to the participants
at the enrollment visit. Spanish versions of
these user instructions are available.
Research coordinators should review the
instructions with participants and answer any
questions. Coordinators should emphasize to
participants that the tube must be shaken
vigorously for at least 30 seconds once the
specimen is added and cap replaced, in order
to ensure the sample is properly stabilized. Once shaking is completed, participants will place the tube into the Ziploc
bag included in the kit, seal the Ziploc bag, and return the bag and Recording Form to the coordinator at the next visit.
The remaining stool will be deposited into the toilet and the toilet paper collection accessory will be flushed.
Participants should remove their gloves and wash their hands, then write the date and time of collection, as well as any
notes on the Recording Form provided.


5.1. OmniGene Stool Kit Contents
The OmniGene Stool Kit will be supplied by the CBR. The OmniGene Stool Kit should be stored at room temperature at
the recruitment site prior to use by the participant and also after return of the specimen.
The Kit contains the following materials, divided into one bag of materials to go to the participant, and one bag to
remain at the RS until return of the sample:
Participant kit materials (see Figure 10A):
• Recording Form (Purpose: for the participant to record time and date of collection)
• User instructions from manufacturer (English provided in kit; Spanish can be printed online if needed)
• Transport bag with handles for returning samples back to the research team
• Ziploc bag for collection vial
• 1 pair of non-latex gloves
• 1 OMNIgene-GUT collection tube and spatula (Note: CBR will pre-label tube)
• 2 toilet paper accessories
Recruitment Site kit materials (see Figure 10B):
Note: do NOT give this set of supplies to the participant; they should remain at the RS until ready for use in shipping the
sample to the CBR.
• Mailer for returning sample to CBR, including liquid biohazard bag with absorbent material, bubble wrap, and
labeled cardboard mailer
• Kit lot insert and tracking manifest

Coordinator Instructions
At Enrollment Visit:
1. Obtain OmniGene Stool Kit from CBR and check expiration date on the kit bag or collection tube.
2. Remove the Recruitment Site materials from the kit and set aside for later use.
3. Verify that the User Instructions and Recording Form are included in the participant kit. If Spanish is needed,
download from Basecamp. Write the participant ID on the Recording Form where indicated and return the
form to the participant kit.
4. Provide the kit to the participant and provide an overview of the instructions. Emphasize that they need to
adequately shake the sample. Show them where to note the date/time of collection on the Recording Form.
Upon Return of Sample:
1. Note sample as recorded in REDCap and input collection data from the Recording Form.
2. Store sample at room temperature until ready to ship to CBR. Use the cardboard Mailer and additional
supplies set aside previously to ship the sample. Ensure the sample arrives at the CBR within 60 days of
collection. See detailed shipping instructions in Section 8.


5.2. Sample Packaging by Participants
The OmniGene tube should be stored in the sealed Ziploc bag after collection. The participant should place the Ziploc
bag and the completed Recording Form in the transport (grocery) bag and return the samples to the research team.


5.3 Sample Collection and Processing by Research Coordinators
Hospitalized participants (AKI participants in particular) may not be able to contribute a stool sample. If nurse assistance
is available, or if the participant is ambulatory and can use a collection hat, coordinators should arrange for a nurse to
page them when a participant has given a sample. The coordinator should bring the OmniGene stool collection kit and
complete the spooning/shaking process in the participant’s restroom, conditions permitting. The sample collection
details should be recorded on the Stool CRF (Section 9) in REDCap. The sample should be kept at room temperature until
shipment to the CBR.


5.3. Delivery of Sample to Research Team
Research coordinator will ideally receive the sample within 24 hours of collection. Ensure that the date and time of the
specimen collection is recorded on the recording form.


5.4. Storage Instructions
Store specimens at room temperature until future shipment to the CBR.


# 6. Local Storage


6.1 ACD tube storage
The ACD tube (baseline only) should NOT be frozen locally prior to shipment to CBR.
 Store at room temperature until ready for shipment. Shipment must occur promptly (same day as
collection). The CBR must receive the tube for processing within 24 hours of the draw.
 Record in SpecTrack (see Section 7)
 Package tube with absorbent material and then use the ambient temperature mailer for shipment to the
CBR (materials provided in ACD Shipper Kit). Please follow instructions in Section 8 for shipping.


6.2 PAXgene RNA tube storage
The PAXgene RNA tube should NOT be frozen immediately
 Store the PAXgene RNA tube upright at room temperature (18˚C - 25˚C) for a minimum of 2 hours and a
maximum of 72 hours, documenting this time on the Blood Collection CRF in REDCap (See Section 9) before
transferring to freezer (-80˚C).
 Store upright loosely in a test tube rack in the -80 freezer until ready for shipment. Do not place PAXgene
tubes in tight test tube containers such as Styrofoam or Plastic as this may lead the tube to break.
 Record in SpecTrack (see Section 7)


6.3 Stool sample storage
The stool (OMNIgene-GUT tube) should be stored at room temperature locally until ready for ambient temperature
shipment to the CBR. The CBR must receive the tube for processing within 60 days of collection.


6.4 All other sample storage
Immediately freeze all other samples (blood, urine) at -80˚C after initial processing and aliquoting.
 Store upright in a labeled box until ready for shipment
 Record in SpecTrack (see Section 7)


# 7. Recording Aliquot and Shipping Details in SpecTrack
Before recording aliquot details, you must record initial specimen collection details within REDCap on the Blood, Timed
Urine, Spot Urine, or Stool Collection forms (see Section 9). Saving these forms in REDCap will automatically transfer all
data related to kit assignment and the initial specimens collected into the KPMP SpecTrack system.


7.1 Recording aliquots
To record which aliquots were filled, log into the SpecTrack system (https://specimen.kpmp.org). On the SpecTrack
landing page use the Kit ID search field to look up the kit that was used for the participant.
On the kit detail page choose the ‘Record Kit Aliquots’ action.
This action will display a form where you can quickly record which aliquots included in the kit were used. If you did not
indicate that a container was collected during the blood draw we will assume no aliquots were created and not display
them.
On this kit aliquot recording form you will select or de-select which aliquots were used. Volumes will be set to the
default for the container; record any difference. Also record the time the aliquot was frozen for each set of aliquots.
The ability to set this metadata across multiple samples at a time is supported so you don’t have to enter the data for
each sample individually.


7.2 Recording sample shipments using SpecTrack
Use the ‘Samples’ tab within SpecTrack to view a list of all samples that have been collected at the site and have not yet
been shipped.
Filter and select the samples you are planning to ship using tray ID or kit ID. Click the ‘Ship Selected Samples’ action.
The selected samples will be inserted into the Sample Shipment form.
Record sample temperatures, total weight of the packed box with dry ice, the site you’re shipping to (address will auto-
populate) and any notes about the shipment or individual samples. Upload images of the shipment contents. See
Section 8 for photo details. If you know the shipment courier and tracking ID, record it at this time. You can also return
to the system to record this data after saving.
After saving the shipment data you will be able to generate a printable shipment manifest. This printed manifest should
be reviewed for accuracy and included in the shipment. Be sure not to tape the box shut until you’ve enclosed the
shipment manifest.
When the shipment data is recorded, an email notification with information about the shipment will be dispatched
automatically by the SpecTrack system to both the receiving and shipping sites.


# 8. Central Biorepository Shipping (University of Michigan)
All biospecimen samples are shipped to the Central Biorepository (CBR) at the University of Michigan.

8.2 Shipping Materials


8.2.1 Provided by CBR
• KPMP Dry Ice Shipper
o Cardboard shipping box with orientation arrows
o Insulated shipping container (to be placed inside cardboard shipping box)
o Foam insert
• UN1845 label
• UN3373 label
• 95 kPa bags
• Address labels (for UN1845)
• Vacutainer sleeve (for RNA PAXgene tube)
• Ambient temperature mailer and absorbent material (for ACD tubes)
• Ambient temperature mailer (for OMNIgene-GUT stool tubes)
• For dry ice shipments: Cryo-Temp data logger inside Ziploc bag


8.2.2 Provided by Site
• Dry Ice (at least 14 lbs per dry ice shipment)
• Scale
• Packaging tape
• KPMP shipping manifest
• Waybill created by site on UPS or FedEx website (FedEx preferred)
Note: Blood and urine should be shipped via FedEx Priority Overnight Delivery. This ensures next day delivery. The CBR
FedEx account number is 644377814.


8.3 Shipping Procedure for Materials shipped on Dry Ice
1. Gather shipping materials listed above (all items except ambient temperature mailer and sleeve, which are for
the ACD tube.)
2. Place UN1845 and UN3373 labels on the same side of KPMP Dry Ice Shipper (do not cover the orientation
arrows.)
3. Fill out the KPMP shipping manifest in SpecTrack, indicating which samples will be included. Be sure to note the
CryoTemp Data Logger ID number in SpecTrack. Print the manifest.
4. Remove biospecimen boxes from freezer.
5. Remove biospecimens from storage boxes and place them in two biohazard bags:
a) All 0.5 mL cryovials should be placed in one bag
b) All other tubes (RNA PAXgene, 4.5 mL cryovials) should be placed in the 2nd bag.
i) RNA PAXgene and the buffy coat tubes should first be placed in vacutainer sleeves to provide
additional protection.
c) Avoid overstuffing the 95 kPa bags (send 50 samples per bag, or less if the samples are the 4.5 mL
cryovials or RNA PAXgene tubes).
6. Place filled biohazard bags in 95 kPa bags. Up to two biohazard bags (one participant-visit) can be placed in a
single 95 kPa bag, and up to two 95 kPa bags (i.e. up to four biohazard bags) can be sent in a single KPMP Dry Ice
Shipper. Prior to sealing the 95 kPa bag, which will be the top-most bag in the box, use a magnet to activate the
pre-chilled CryoTemp Data Logger. Once activated, ensure the logger is in a sealed Ziploc bag and then place the
logger/bag inside the 95 kPa bag and seal.
a) Note: it is allowable to ship the biospecimens in the same KPMP Dry Ice Shipper as biopsy materials. In
that case, either:
i) One 95 kPa bag should be included, and should be packaged on top of one or two cardboard
freezer boxes worth of biopsy samples, or
ii) Two 95 kPa bags can be included, and can be packaged on top of one cardboard freezer box
worth of biopsy samples
7. Place a thin layer of dry ice pellets on the bottom of the empty KPMP Dry Ice Shipper, and then place the filled
95 kPa bags on top of the ice (or on top of the cardboard freezer boxes, if including biopsy samples). The 95 kPa
bags may need to be folded in half in order to fit. If sending two 95 kPa bags, place them one on top of the
other.
8. Take a photo of the biohazard bag(s) filled with sample vials resting at the bottom of the empty KPMP Dry Ice
Shipper (see example image below). The image should fill the available photo area (i.e. don't take the photo too
far away). The photo should demonstrate that the uppermost 95 kPa bag contains the CryoTemp Data Logger.
The photo should be uploaded to SpecTrack.
9. Top off the KPMP Dry Ice Shipper with dry ice, up to a point approximately three inches from the top. Retain
enough space for the foam insert to be placed on top. Once filled, shake the Shipper from side-to-side to ensure
dry ice has settled, and fill any space created with additional dry ice.
a) At least 14 lbs of dry ice must be included. On average the total weight of the box should be around 25-
30 pounds, with a dry ice weight of 15-20 pounds.
b) Take another photo of the now-filled Shipper for uploading to SpecTrack.
10. Place foam insert on top of the KPMP Dry Ice Shipper cooler, ensuring it “seats” properly, then place completed
KPMP SpecTrack manifest on top (outside the Styrofoam inner container, but inside the outer cardboard box).
a) NOTE: if the contents of the shipment changed while you prepped it, make sure to revise and re-print
the SpecTrack manifest.
11. Fold the flaps of the outer cardboard box of the KPMP Dry Ice Shipper over the manifest and seal the box with 1-
2 pieces of packaging tape. Tape should fully cover the flaps and extend at least 2 inches down the sides of the
box.
12. Weigh the sealed shipment. Record the total weight and the dry ice weight for the courier (estimate the dry ice
weight as the total weight minus 7 pounds (approximately the weight of the biospecimens and the KPMP
shipper).
13. Add addresses (or address stickers) and dry ice weight to UN1845 labels.
a) Be sure to write the dry ice weight (in kilograms; 2lbs=1kg) on the UN1845 label, not the TOTAL weight.
This must match the dry ice weight you report to the courier when creating the shipment.
14. Create shipment on courier website, print manifest and attach label to package. Remember to schedule shipping
for Priority Overnight delivery (if shipping via FedEx courier).
15. Bring package to your courier pickup location.
16. Add the total weight of the package and the tracking number to SpecTrack.
17. Check inbox to ensure SpecTrack generated a shipping notification with copy to KPMP-BioRep@umich.edu


8.4 Shipping Procedure for ACD Tubes (ambient temperature)
NOTE: The ACD tube should not be drawn if it cannot make Thursday afternoon shipment to CBR. It should not be drawn
on Fridays or Saturdays. The CBR must receive it for processing within 24 hours of the draw and is not staffed for
processing over the weekend.
1. Gather ambient temperature mailer and sleeve.
2. Fill out the KPMP shipping manifest in SpecTrack, indicating which samples will be included.
3. Insert ACD tubes into the sleeve and take a photo for upload to SpecTrack. Then place the sleeve inside the
ambient temperature mailer, along with the manifest. Take another photo for upload to SpecTrack.
4. Tape the ambient temperature mailer closed.
5. Weigh and record the weight of the filled sleeve.
6. Create shipment on UPS/FedEx website and attach label to package. Remember to schedule shipping for Priority
Overnight delivery
7. Bring package to your UPS/FedEx pickup location.
8. Add the total weight of the package and the tracking number to SpecTrack.
9. Check inbox to ensure SpecTrack generated a shipping notification with copy to KPMP-BioRep@umich.edu.
ACD Shipment Best Practices:
• Staff should monitor ACD tubes after dropping off the box at the courier pick-up point, and make sure it is
picked up (double check before you leave for day).
• If there are concerns, sites can consider calling FedEx to schedule a pick up, instead of relying on drop-off
points.
• Contact the CBR if there are any concerns about a tube and/or help is needed with tracking/contacting FedEx.


8.5 Shipping Procedure for OmniGene Stool Tubes (ambient temperature)
NOTE: The stool tubes must arrive at the CBR within 60 days post collection.
1. Gather ambient temperature mailer (included in each OmniGene Stool Kit).
2. Fill out the KPMP shipping manifest in SpecTrack, indicating which samples will be included. Print the manifest.
3. Insert the tightly capped stool tube inside provided biohazard bag with absorbent material and seal the bag:
4. Fold the sealed biohazard bag with tube and place into the bubble bag. Take a photo for upload to SpecTrack.
1
5. Place the bubble bag, along with the SpecTrack shipping manifest into the cardboard envelope. Seal the
cardboard envelope closed.
6. Weigh and record the weight of the filled mailer.
7. Create shipment on UPS/FedEx website and attach label to package. Use Ground shipping.
8. Bring package to your UPS/FedEx pickup location.
9. Add the total weight of the package and the tracking number to SpecTrack.
10. Check inbox to ensure SpecTrack generated a shipping notification with copy to KPMP-BioRep@umich.edu.

# 9. Biospecimen Form
Data need to be captured on the collection and processing details of biospecimens collected for KPMP. All data need to
be uploaded electronically but paper forms are available to facilitate ease of capture for coordinators.
Section 9 of this MOP includes the paper version of the forms that capture data pertaining to the collection of
biosamples. Coordinators wishing to use these forms to track data should print from this MOP and keep a supply on
hand locally. Data collected on these Section 9 forms then need to be transferred to the corresponding CRFs in REDCap
when the coordinator is able.
Following centrifugation, data need to be captured on an aliquot-level basis. The CBR is providing sample ID-specific
worksheets in each individual kit (i.e. blood kits, stool kits, spot urine kit, timed urine kit) where details pertaining to
aliquot volumes, times frozen, etc. can be recorded on paper. Data collected on these worksheets then need to be
transferred to the corresponding aliquot space in SpecTrack when the coordinator is able.

10.1 Clean-Catch Instructions for Participants Giving a Spot Urine Sample
Please follow these instructions to collect a clean-catch midstream urine specimen:
1. Wash your hands with soap and water.
2. Remove the lid of the urine container, taking care not to touch the inside of the container.
3. Follow the appropriate instructions below:
4. Start to urinate into the toilet, then stop. Do not collect the first amount of urine.
5. Begin urinating into the urine container; stop when it is approximately ¾ full.
6. Finish urinating into the toilet.
7. Place the lid on the urine container.
8. Bring the container to the research coordinator.
FEMALE MALE
Separate your genital folds (also called lips
or labia) and gently wipe the inside of the
folds with an antiseptic towelette, wiping
from front to back.
Before you start urinating, gently wipe the tip of
the penis around the opening with antiseptic
towelette. If you have not been circumcised and
still have your foreskin, gently pull the foreskin
back before you wash the tip of the penis. Keep
holding it back until you are finished getting the
urine sample.
10.2 Timed (24-hour) Urine Collection Instructions for Participants
Instructions for your timed urine collection
1. You will be given a 24-hour urine collection bottle. It will need to be kept in the refrigerator or on ice.
2. Always start your 24-hour urine collection in the morning, when you wake up.
3. Do not save the first urine of the day, but mark this as your START TIME at the bottom of this sheet.
4. Save all urine after this for the next 24 hours in the collection bottle. Women may use the provided
collection ‘hat’ to cover the toilet seat and make collection easier. Men may use the provided urinal.
5. In order to get correct results, it is important to save every urine sample. If you forget to save any urine,
please make sure to mark it at the bottom of this sheet.
6. The last urine sample should be as close to the starting time as possible and must be saved.
7. Please remember to keep urine in the collection bottle in the refrigerator or on ice. If on ice, make sure the
ice is at the level of the urine. When transporting the bottle to clinic, please pack ice packs around it if it
will take you longer than one hour to travel to clinic. You can make your own ice pack if needed by
putting ice cubes in a Ziploc bag.
